# handwritten-digit-recognition-system
This project focuses on recognising the handwritten digit using data which contains images containing 0 to 9. The proposed system consists of capturing images, generating and loading dataset, train-test split, fit the model using svc, calculating accuracy and predicting image using modules like OpenCV, CSV, GLOB, etc.
